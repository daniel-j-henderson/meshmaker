Given a list of 3d points on the sphere, this program now will calculate timing information for the partitioning, stereographic projection/Delaunay triangulation, and Lloyd iteration (weight computation/relaxation) stages of the mesh generation process. No mesh is produced at the end, only timing info. Use the 'addmpi' branch for an MPI implementation. 

Use:

./meshmaker points_filename number_of_iterations

points_filename: see iofiles/x1.40962.point.txt for example
